# Code-for-Arduino-Uno-10X8-LED-matrix
The code is for directly controlling the LED matrix (I had made a 10X8 matrix) through Arduino Uno. Here, I have used multiplexing which makes the task a bit difficult to understand at first. But once you gain command of this concept,it seems to be quite a useful technique. Give it a try. Focus on understanding the code and functioning.
